# Breast Cancer Detection:Comparing the accuracy of three models
## Overview
### This whole project is developed in Python and applies three Machine learning Algorithms :__SVM , Logistic Regression and Decision Tree__
* In this project, I use scikit learn's libraries to perform all steps starting from exploratory data analysis(EDA) to model evaluation.
* Can be run on your local machine, Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
  
## Goal of the project
* The goal of the project is to classify tumors as __benign__ or __malignant__ based on given features.
* Perform __hyperparameter tuning__ to determine which model achieves the best performance on this dataset.

## Dataset
* You can download the dataset from Kaggle: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Requirements
* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
